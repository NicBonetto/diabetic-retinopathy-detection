# diabetic-retinopathy-detection
A deep learning model that detects and classifies diabetic retinopathy.

## Description
An end-to-end deep learning system for automated detection and grading of diabetic retinopathy from retinal images. This project implements transfer learning with CNN architectures (ResNet, EfficientNet), handles class imbalance, and provides interpretability through Grad-CAM visualizations. Includes comprehensive evaluations and production-ready code. 

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- GPU recommended (but not required)
- ~15GB available for dataset
